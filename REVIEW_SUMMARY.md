## ⚠️ What Needs Work

### 1. Critical Issues (Block Production)

#### 🔴 Firestore Security Rules Incomplete
**File:** `firestore.rules`
- ❌ No actual collection-level rules
- ❌ Helper functions not implemented
- ❌ Database currently **UNSECURED**
- **Fix:** See `CRITICAL_FIXES_GUIDE.md` section 2

#### 🔴 Mock Repositories in Use
**Files to Delete:**
- `food_safety_repository_impl.dart` (mock stub)
- `analytics_repository_impl.dart` (mock stub)
- **Risk:** App using mocks instead of Firebase!
- **Fix:** See `CRITICAL_FIXES_GUIDE.md` section 1

#### 🔴 Dependency Injection Not Generated
- ❌ Manual DI registration instead of generated code
- ❌ Risk of incorrect service registration
- **Fix:** Run `flutter pub run build_runner build`

#### 🔴 Configuration Files Exposed
- ❌ `google-services.json` committed to git
- ❌ API keys visible in code
- **Security Risk:** High
- **Fix:** See `CRITICAL_FIXES_GUIDE.md` section 3

### 2. High Priority Issues

#### ⚠️ Missing UI (80% of app)
**Current UI:** Login, Register, Stations pages only  
**Missing:**
- Orders/KDS main screen (critical!)
- Recipe management
- Inventory management
- Timer management
- Table management
- Food safety compliance
- Cost tracking
- Analytics dashboard

#### ⚠️ Missing BLoCs (70%)
**Implemented:** AuthBloc, StationBloc  
**Missing:** RecipeBloc, InventoryBloc, TimerBloc, TableBloc, CostTrackingBloc, AnalyticsBloc

#### ⚠️ No Real-time Subscriptions
- ❌ No `Stream<List<Order>>` for live order updates
- ❌ No real-time station status
- ❌ No live timer countdowns
- **Impact:** Can't see updates without refresh

### 3. Medium Priority Issues

#### 📋 Code Cleanup Needed
- ⚠️ Duplicate use case files (food_safety has 3 versions!)
- ⚠️ Duplicate BLoC files (order_bloc.dart vs order_bloc_simple.dart)
- ⚠️ Unused dependencies (compiler warnings)

#### 📋 Testing Gaps
- **Domain:** 85% ✅
- **Application:** 40% ⚠️
- **Infrastructure:** 5% ❌
- **Presentation:** 15% ❌
- **Target:** 70%+ for production

#### 📋 No Error Handling in UI
- ❌ No global error boundaries
- ❌ No offline support
- ❌ No retry mechanisms
- ❌ No loading states in some widgets

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Can I deploy this to production now?
**A:** No. Critical security issues (Firestore rules, exposed config) must be fixed first.

### Q: How long until production-ready?
**A:** 6-8 weeks with focused development. Critical fixes: 1 day. UI completion: 4 weeks. Quality/testing: 2-3 weeks.

### Q: What's the #1 priority?
**A:** Fix security (Firestore rules + configuration). Then build Orders UI.

### Q: Should I use Firebase or stick with mocks?
**A:** Use Firebase! You have 9/11 repositories fully implemented. Just remove the mocks.

### Q: Is the architecture good?
**A:** Excellent! Your domain layer is among the best I've reviewed. Clean Architecture implementation is textbook.

### Q: What's missing for MVP?
**A:** Orders UI, Recipe UI, Inventory UI, and proper error handling. That's your critical path.
